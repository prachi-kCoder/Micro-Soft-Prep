# JOB SCHEDULING:

- Maximun profit jobs schelude with weighted jobs & specific time line : DP + Binary Search optimization , https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/description/
- Maximum job Sequencing with deadline only , : Greedy -> Slot assignment optimised with DSU implementation ! : - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/job-sequencing-problem-1587115620/1
- Max OVERLAP OF PLATFORM  : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms-1587115620/1
- ACTIVITY SELETION : Max no of jobs to be done , unweighted jobs : GREEDY sorting + taking then non overlapping ones !


# Greedy :
- KSUM of array : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-sum-of-an-array/submissions/1890948648/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=7p5x763
- With bitmasking it was amazing ! O(NLOGN + KLOGN) tc , sc = O(N ) by PQ, abs_val
